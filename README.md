# Trie Tree Autocomplete Engine

### Implemented an autocomplete engine using a trie tree data structure. Tested with the complete works of Shakespeare and famous speeches from Martin Luther King / Greta Thunberg as input work banks.

In this autocomplete engine, I coded a Node class and Trie class to store words from an input word bank or dictionary. It supports insertion, lookup, printing the list of unqiue words in alphabetical order, finding the k most common words, and autocompleting prefixes based on occurrence.
